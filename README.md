# Java Versions Cheat Sheet

This is the project for the single web page **[Java Versions Cheat Sheet](https://andbin.github.io/java-versions-cheat-sheet)** showing all the Java versions with valuable information and links.

Note that the web page is **not** handwritten. Instead, it is generated using XSLT transformation (XML+XSL). You can find the `.xml` and `.xsl` files in the `src/` folder.

I performed the transformation using **Saxon PE** (the *Professional Edition* for which I have the paid license) by running a simple handcrafted `build.bat` file. I cannot disclose this batch file simply because it is specific to my machine. However, if you are proficient in XML/XSL technologies, you can take those two files and generate the HTML page yourself using an XSLT processor of your choice.
